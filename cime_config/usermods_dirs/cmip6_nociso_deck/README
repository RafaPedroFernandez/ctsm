WACCM DECK runs should be configured similarly to CAM DECK runs, but
without virtual elevation classes over Antarctica. At 2-degree we
+also decided to NOT turn on Carbon isotopes.

(2024-08-06) RafaPedroFernandez created the cmip6_nociso_deck folder and 
removed the carbon isotope following the same performed for WACCM 
(cmip6_waccm_nociso_deck). IMPORTANT TO CHECK and VALIDATE !!!
